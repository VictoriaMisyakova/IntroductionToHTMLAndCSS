    <p>Dogs are wonderful pets, many people love them. Dogs are friendly and loyal animals. They like to spend time with humans and are known as «man’s best friend.» Dogs can learn tricks and follow commands like sit, stay, and come. This makes them great companions for people.</p>
    <p class="cleared">Taking care of a dog is important. They need food, water, and a cozy place to sleep. Dogs also need exercise to stay healthy, so going for walks and playing fetch is fun for them.</p>
    <p>Different breeds of dogs have different characteristics. Some are good at herding, some are good swimmers, and others are great at protecting homes. Some dogs even help people with special jobs, like guiding those who cannot see.</p>
